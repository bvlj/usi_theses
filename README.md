- Abstract:
> Learning how to program is hard.
> In particular, code comprehension has been shown to be challenging and
> important for a positive learning outcome.
> Students don't always understand the code they write.
> This has been exacerbated by the advent of large language models that
> automatically generate code that may or may not be correct.
> Now students don't just have to understand their own code, but they have to
> be able to critically analyze automatically generated code.
>
> Prior research has shown that while expressions are one of the most prevalent
> constructs in student code, they are one of the most neglected constructs in
> programming education.
> Even in imperative languages like Java, expressions make up a significant
> fraction of the code students produce.
>
> To support teaching and assessing students about expressions, we utilize a
> notional machine called "Expressions as Trees".
> Notional machines are pedagogical devices that assist the understanding of
> certain aspects of programming.
> The "Expression as Tree" notional machine focuses on expressions:
> students have to decompose source code expressions and represent them as
> trees.
>
> In this document, we define and implement an assessment platform around
> this "Expression as Trees" notional machine.
> Our platform can automatically generate personalized learning activities
> for students based on students' own source code.
> Our platform asks students to construct expression trees for interesting
> expressions in the code they submitted in programming assignments.
> It then automatically assesses the students' expression trees and
> provides feedback to both students and instructors.
>
> We evaluate the various aspects of the implemented system, including the
> automatic activity generation and the formative feedback provided to students.
> The evaluation highlights the usefulness of the automatic system for a
> positive learning experience that can align with the instructor's learning
> objectives.

- Abstract:
> Expressions are a fundamental concept of programming languages: they combine
> values with functions and operators to produce other values.
> Programming languages define rules that determine how expressions are combined
> and evaluated to perform tasks.
>
> Teaching students how to interpret expressions is fundamental in order to
> ensure they can understand how a given programming language works.
> In order to teach and learn expressions, one has to actually write
> expressions, be it for explaining concepts, studying or making exercises to
> ensure that knowledge has been acquired.
>
> While the process of writing expressions may look like an easy task, it
> actually is a tedious and very errorâ€“prone process due to how a language was
> defined.
>
> We want to develop a tool to aid in the process of writing expressions by
> automating the whole process: to do so, our _Expression Generator_ will be
> able to create expressions from language grammars definitions.
> It is possible to customize the expressions that will be generated with a
> number of constraints applied to the generator, allowing for the teaching
> of specific topics or scaling the complexity of the generated expression
> string.
